      Welcome to my GitHub page! 
        My name is Darwyne Azueta and I am currently pursuing my education at the University of Belize.
        I have a background in architecture, but my true passion lies in coding and learning about new technologies.
        I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and the environment, 
        and I am a strong advocate for conservation and sustainable practices. 
        
        When I'm not busy coding, you can find me experimenting with visual effects and exploring different ways 
        to bring creativity into my work. As a firm believer in the power of collaboration, 
        I am always excited to work with other developers and learn from their experiences. 
        Please feel free to contact me at itsdarwyne2@gmail.com if you choose to do so.
     Let's collaborate to create something incredible.
